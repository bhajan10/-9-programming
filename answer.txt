1) Shebang Explanation:
The shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python3) tells the operating system which interpreter
should be used to run the script. It allows the script to be executed directly without
explicitly calling the python command.

2) How I executed hello.py without using python:
I made the file executable and ran it directly.

Commands used:
- chmod +x hello.py

- ./hello.py

3) Why Python runs directly but C requires compilation:
Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line by the Python
interpreter at runtime. C is a compiled language, so the source code must first be converted
into machine code using a compiler before it can run.

Interpreter vs Compiler:
An interpreter executes code directly line by line, while a compiler translates the entire
program into an executable file before execution.

4) C compilation and execution commands:
- gcc hello.c -o hello
- ./hello
